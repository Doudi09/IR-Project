<h1>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROJECT 

README.md


This practical work project contains the basic procedures (modules) in information 
retrieval (IR) :

	(1) document indexing, 
	(2) term weighting and 
	(3) matching. request-document. 

In this project we will use the CACM collection. This collection is stored in :
/CACM/

The parsed and processed data can be found in : /DATA/
We will realize 2 diffrents models to retrieve information from the collection used :

	1 The Boolean model, 
	2 The Vector model and the evaluation of the formulas of the Vector model.

The code source can be found at : /CODE/Traitement


At the end a User interface has been added to facilite the visualisation of differents models developed and the results obtained.

The UI is developed with PyQt5 and you can find it on : /UI/mainwindow
